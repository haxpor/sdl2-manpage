.SH NAME
\fBSDL_AudioStream\fR -- Structure

.SH SYNOPSIS
An opaque structure that buffers, converts, resamples, and generally streams audio data.

.SH REMARKS
The \fBSDL_AudioStream\fR structure is used to convert audio data between different formats in arbitrarily-sized blocks. It is meant to be a replacement for the \fBSDL_AudioCVT\fR-related interfaces.

A tutorial on using audio stream is at \fITutorials-AudioStream\fR (https://wiki.libsdl.org/Tutorials-AudioStream).

(this page should be fleshed out more, too).
